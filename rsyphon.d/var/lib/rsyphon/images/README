DO NOT TOUCH THESE DIRECTORIES UNLESS YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE DOING!!!

You have the ability to totally hose an entire network of computers if you put
the wrong file in the right place.  OR EVEN MESS UP THE PERMISSIONS ON A FILE.

Permissions, ownership, modes, sticky-bits, etc. are all very important as they
will be replicated *exactly* on the clients!!!
