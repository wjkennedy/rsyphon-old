*** System Configurator Project ***

System Configurator is a project which attempts to be an automated system
setup utility for Linux.

It smooths over differences between Linux distributions and hardware platforms
by providing a unified API to set up networking, hardware, and boot strapping.

System Configurator is heavily developed by a 
crack team of ring tailed lemurs.  Any issues should be directed to their feeder
at sisuite-users@lists.sourceforge.net.

It is still in its infancy, so if you wish to help out, please visit the 
System Configurator home page (http://systemconfig.sourceforge.net).
