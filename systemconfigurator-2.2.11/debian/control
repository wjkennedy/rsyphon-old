Description: Unified Configuration API for Linux Installation
 Provides an API for various installation and configuration processes that are
 otherwise inconsistent between the many Linux distributions, and the many
 architectures they run on.  For example, you can configure the bootloader
 on a system in a general way - you don't need to know anything about the
 particular boot loader on the system.  You can update the network settings
 of a system, without knowing the distribution or the format of its network
 configuration files.
