- There must me a YaBoot image named "/boot/yaboot" or "/boot/yaboot.chrp.
- If running under a temporary root, $TEMPROOT, the image must be named "$TEMPROOT/boot/yaboot" or 
  "$TEMPROOT/boot/yaboot.chrp". 
- YaBoot image will be written to all PREP partitions found on the disk specified by BOOTDEV option. (Notice 
  that the partition portion of BOOTDEV option will be ignored.) 
  If BOOTDEV option is not specified, i.e. being called from System Imager, YaBoot image will be written to
  all PREP partitions found in the system. 
- This version of System Configurator supports CHRP platform only.
