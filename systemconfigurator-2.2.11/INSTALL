***  System Configurator Installation Guide ***

Prerequisites
------------------------------
*  perl 5.005 (the whole thing is written in perl)
*  AppConfig >= 1.52

AppConfig can be found on CPAN (www.cpan.org).  For your
convenience we have created a perl-AppConfig rpm package on 
our project page (http://sf.net/projects/systemconfig).  It should work 
on most Perl installs.  On Debian Systems you can apt-get
the libappconfig-perl debian package from your local mirror.

You can also attempt to install AppConfig via the CPAN module by 
running 'perl -MCPAN -e shell' on the command line, and go from there.  
(man CPAN for more info).

The slightly harder way to get them is by downloading the following URLs:
  * http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/ABW/AppConfig-1.52.tar.gz
