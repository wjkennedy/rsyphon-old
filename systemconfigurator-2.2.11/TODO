System Configurator TODO List (as of Aug 1st 2001)
--------------------------------------------------
This todo list is brought to you because Trey was rightfully getting
on my case about the fact that we didn't have one.  Hopefully it will
let people know what needs to be done.

Documentation Work
------------------
* Pod docs for all Modules in Network:: and Modules:: name spaces need updating
* New sample.cfg file must be created for new config file options

Website Work
------------------
* Documentation needs to be created about Hardware Detection for the website
* Documentation about Lilo, Grub, and Yaboot bootloaders needed on website
* More Distro stats for other distributions needed on the website

Minor Code Work
------------------
* Networking to support Slackware needs to be added
* Repackaging of libappconfig-perl rpm to make it test whether
  or not it installed propperly
* Figure out a way to factor out constructor from Modules::* and
  put it in Modules::Generic (can probably do this with a couple of
  package variables).

Major Code Work
------------------
* Implement promiscous mode:
  - Detect all hardware and setup network interfaces which are not user specified
  - Detect all kernels in /boot and / and add them to the $config kernel\d blocks

Ports (platforms we want to work on)
------------------
* Alpha
* zSeries (S/390)
